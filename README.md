### Design a network to approximate some unknown function.

The dataset contains the data which are the outputs from an unknown function
𝑦=𝑓(𝑥1,𝑥2).
Note that the given training dataset has been disturbed by some noise. You are now required to design a network to remove the introduced noise. After finishing your network training, you need to produce the outputs for a given testing dataset. Kaggle will compute the mean square error (MSE) between your outputs and the true outputs for the performance evaluation of your network.
